overview: In this self-intitiated project, I designed and implemented the identity, website, and menu for a fictional restaurant. If I owned a restuarant, it would be Hearth, so creating the branding was both challenging and fulfilling. I wanted the brand to evoke the of warmth and togetherness of sitting around the dinner table with loved ones while still looking modern.
